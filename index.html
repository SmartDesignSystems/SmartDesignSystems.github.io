								proposes to develop and implement innovative algorithms required to build a software package that will help engineers achieve designs that properly balance reliability and cost. The resulting risk-based design is challenging because it is computationally very time consuming, involving both sophisticated numerical models of the structure being designed, and also Monte Carlo simulations in order to estimate its reliability. Algorithms which speed up the numerical modeling using advanced computer hardware are essential to assessing the reliability of a particular design. Added to this is the problem of finding optimal designs which take design and construction costs into account. Risked based design methodologies will be developed to identify the best potential designs, along with their cost and reliability, so that the engineer can make an informed decision regarding the optimal design.

							<h1>ENTREVESTOR: Smart Engineering using AI to alter designs</h1>
							<div class="pt-10 pb-20">

							</div>
							<p align="justify"> A team of Dalhousie University faculty members is creating engineering software to partly automate the designing of buildings, and has already arranged two pilot projects with the solution.
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
							</p>
							<p align="justify">
Smart Engineering, co-founded by faculty members Reza Rahimi and Gordon Fenton, will allow engineers to request a change to a design, and then use artificial intelligence to implement the change without compromising the rest of the structure.
</p>
<p align="justify">
“If an engineer wants to move a column from Point A to Point B, they won’t have to redesign the whole building because the software will re-calculate the design for them,” said Rahimi in an interview.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Other drafting software is already widely used in the industry, but Smart Engineering aims to be the first company to offer a product that automates many of the calculations that ensure a building is structurally sound.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The introduction of automation is made possible by a change in how the program uses computer hardware.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Most software runs on a computer’s core processing unit, or CPU. Smart Engineering’s AI will instead run on a computer’s graphics card.
</p>
<p align="justify">
A CPU usually has between two and eight cores. The number of cores corresponds to how many computational tasks the computer can complete at once.
</p>
<p align="justify">
By design, a graphics card is only meant to perform the calculations that produce a computer’s visual output, which is displayed on the monitor. A graphics card has a less powerful core than a CPU, but may have thousands of them, rather than only a handful.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The increased number of available cores makes it possible for many more calculations to be performed simultaneously, which provide the processing power Rahimi and Fenton need for their AI system.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Smart Engineering will market itself to engineering consultancy firms, whose business model is partly volume-based.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Consulting companies bid on large numbers of projects and each bid involves creating a new design. Automation will help them create more designs in less time, while still maintaining safety standards.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Rahimi also plans to target universities, which he hopes will purchase the software for their students. That would mean the companies the students end up working for would be more inclined to buy it, said Rahimi.
</p>
<p align="justify">
“If they have employees coming in and saying, ‘I’m comfortable with Smart Engineering,’ the employer will be more likely to buy the software,” Rahimi said.
</p>
<p align="justify">
He and Fenton have arranged two pilot projects: one with Dalhousie and one with engineering consultancy firm CBCL Limited.
</p>
<p align="justify">
They plan to begin small-scale testing of the software a year from now, roll out a more complete “beta” version in two years, and have the finished product ready in three.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The software will be cloud-based to limit the hardware requirements for users.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Potential customers have told Rahimi that they would prefer not to pay a monthly subscription, because their usage levels will ebb and flow depending on how busy they are. Instead, they will pay for the software on a per-design basis.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Universities, however, will still be offered a monthly subscription model because students practising their skills are likely to use the software more consistently.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The company is aiming to raise enough money from publicly backed funding sources, such as Crown corporation Innovacorp, to pay for the first two years of the development process.
</p>
<p align="justify">
After that, Rahimi says they will look to the private sector.

										Smart Design Systems, formerly Smart Engineering, is developing a cloud-based software package that will allow engineers to analyze the safety of structures they design. Unlike existing software, Smart Design Systems uses computer graphics cards for its calculations, which will significantly improve speed and allow engineering firms to quickly assess possible options.
